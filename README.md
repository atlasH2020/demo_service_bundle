# ATLAS-H2020 demo service bundle

This is a web application that exposes several demonstration ATLAS services. These services are not suitable for production purposes but provide ATLAS-compliant APIs on a fixed set of data and can therefore be used in the initial development cycle of an ATLAS-enabled Digital System.

Note that OAUth2 base authentication is properly implemented. You may use this service as a template for your own full-fledged ATLAS service.
